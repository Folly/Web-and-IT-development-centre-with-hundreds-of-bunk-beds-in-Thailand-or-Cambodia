IT and web development centre with hundreds of bunk beds in Thailand or Cambodia

What is the product or service being offered?

We want to build a web development centre where developers, web designers and social media people can meet, live and collaborate.

What is the intended target market?

The target market is nerds, geeks and web designers, who want to work on projects in a safe and healthy environment in a tropical climate. The intended target market for the products and services being developed at the facilities is a general world audience since we primarily will be developing software, web sites, cell phone applications and so on.

What is the benefit of the product or service?

The benefit of this service is that skilled programmers, web designers and social media people can collaborate closely together in a safe, clean, friendly and healthy environment so it will be a micro Silicon Valley for tiny to midsized startups.

Any additional details?

Apart from just being a web and IT development centre we will have a strong focus on health. Alcohol and drugs including coffee, tea and chocolate will not be tolerated on the premises. We will try to let everyone have access to a swimming pool and encourage people to spend at least an hour a day swimming to strengthen the physique of these poor nerds. We will try to give everyone access to computer screens where you can turn off the backlight so as to save the poor developers eyes. We will try to ensure that everyone is eating healthy meals at least three times a day. No candy will be sold at the premises, only fruit and fruit juice, plain yoghurt, dark rye bread, brown rice and other healthy stuff like that. 

How will the product be positioned relative to similar ones in the 
market?

There are no products or services similar to this one in the cities I have researched to the best of my knowledge so we will have a unique product.

How will the product or service be sold and distributed?

The products and services which are created through at this startup space will be sold and distributed online, for instance through web shops, sales, financial instruments and so on.

How will you execute this project?

I will rent a building to start with, arrange AC and broadband fibre.

Do you have any previous relevant experience?

I have created a crowdfunding campaign in the past.

I know a lot of web, IT and social media people.

What is the name of your network and how many people are involved?

I just refer to my peeps as the network. We are a loosely connected, decentralized network of thousands of computer enthusiasts.

What happens if you fail?

I don't know what happens if I fail. I usually win. However, don't hold me liable if something goes wrong, my life is hard enough as it is. If we cannot reach the target we will have to reconsider what to do, perhaps put the money in one of the other projects we're involved with.

How will the business framework be set up?

If we manage to raise the funding, a limited company will be registered. I will personally keep a majority of the shares, say 55% or so. I will keep 10% of the donated amount to cover my expenses for setting up this project and for being involved during the development. I will appoint some friendly and knowledgeable person to coordinate the project locally and ensure that the deadlines are met.
